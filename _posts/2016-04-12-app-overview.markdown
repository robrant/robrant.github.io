During development of Lighthouse we have tried our best to keep the
application's user interface as intuitive as possible for users. In a similar
sense, we've tried to keep internal code intefaces as intuitive as possible for
developers who might be working on the project in the future. In any project,
however, there is bound to be some level of ambiguity. This is why we've
documented the application "flow".

So from this journal entry you may download a PDF containing three diagrams:

* an entity-relationship diagram for the database which Lighthouse uses
* a "Site Overview" which features every application view and how they relate 
(excluding global navigation relationships) to other views
* a flow diagram explaining the internal logic which takes place when a user
tries to log in.
