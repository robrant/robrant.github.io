## Context

As well as working code, we want to deliver an insight into agile working. One
way to do this is to document how we approach being a team as well as just
writing code. As part of the initial project kick-off, Roo created two draft
documents in Google Drive, one for team values and one for ways of working.

After the team was fully assembled, Norm demonstrated how in a previous job
the team he was in had used a repository in GitHub to document the code and
expect team behaviours and suggested this as a good working model for this
project.

By adopting this model we would have a proper history of what changed and
when, which would help demonstrate how the team can adapt their behaviours in
an agile manner, especially after retrospectives.

## Decision

Use GitHub. Both to have a place to document how an agile team thinks and
behaves, but also to have a proper history to document how an agile team can
and will evolve in their opinions and behaviours.

## Status

We are using GitHub for our [team principles][principles].

## Consequences

There is more to write down.
